                <h2>About plastic pollution</h2>
                <p>Because plastic does not biodegrade, it breaks down over time into small 
                    pieces called microplastics. 
                    Microscopic plastic is to rise to our table and on the marine food chain. 
                    It threatens the health of ourselves and our family.
                    Plastic was once the epitome of convenience. 
                    But now we face an uncomfortable truth. 
                    Abandoned plastic fishing lines strangle turtles and seabirds, and countless marine 
                    animals mistakenly eat shredded plastic pieces for food, leading to death.

                    Greenpeace is campaigning for stores, retailers and businesses to take the lead 
                    in reducing disposable plastic. 
                    Everyone has to work together to solve the problem of plastic pollution, 
                    which is already a global crisis. 
                    Not just individuals, but businesses and governments alike. 
                    Greenpeace argues that efforts to reduce disposable plastic should begin 
                    throughout the industry. Please join us to prevent our beautiful Earth from 
                    being polluted for centuries for a moment's use.

            <h2>Did you know?</h2>
            <p>Of the 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic produced 
                worldwide between 1950 and 2015, 6.3 billion 
                tonnes were discarded, and only 9% was recycled. 
                Disposable plastics account for 40% of total plastic production, 
                but the average usage time is only 6 months, 
                and it takes over 500 years to rot.

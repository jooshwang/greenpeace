                <p>
                    <strong>Let me introduce Greenpeace.</strong>
                    Greenpeace has 26 offices in 55 countries across Europe, 
                    America, Asia, Africa and the Pacific.
                    Greenpeace only receives donations from individual 
                    sponsors or independent patrons, not governments or corporations, 
                    to maintain its independence.
                    Greenpeace has campaigned against environmental destruction
                    since 1971, and has been using nonviolent methods to lumber 
                    and augment environmental destruction sites.

            <p>
                Greenpeace is present in 55 countries 
                across Europe, 
                the Americas, Asia, Africa and the Pacific.
                Greenpeace East Asia opened its Hong Kong office in 1997, 
                Beijing in 2002, Taipei in 2010 and Seoul in 2011. 
                Surging economic development 
                in East Asia has brought widespread prosperity, 
                but has also taken a severe environmental toll, 
                both regionally and worldwide.
